# Todo

## Upcoming (pre-1.0)

* New user experience
* Useful error message for bad MySQL credentials

## Eventually (1.1 or later)

* Don't load results unless necessary
* Paginate large result sets? (probably no)
* Restartable queries
* Reports/query groups
* Processlist monitor
* Email notifications
* True multiuser
* Comments
* Idea: decelerate polling as query runtime increases
