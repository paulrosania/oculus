Oculus is a web-based logging SQL client.  It keeps a history of your queries
and the results they returned, so your research is always at hand, easy to share
and easy to repeat or reproduce in the future.

**Oculus will not prevent you from doing stupid things! I recommend using a
readonly SQL account.**

## Installation

    $ gem install oculus
    $ gem install mysql2 # to enable MySQL support
    $ gem install pg     # to enable Postgres support

## Usage

Oculus is a Sinatra app. Run it from the command line, or mount `Oculus::Server`
as middleware in your Rack application (recommended). For more information on
mounting Oculus as middleware, see the wiki:
[Running with Rack](https://github.com/paulrosania/oculus/wiki/Running-with-Rack).

For details on command line options, run:
